# Kairn â€“ The European Sovereign Cloud Assistant ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

**Kairn** is an open-source AI assistant designed to **guide organizations in their transition toward sovereign and ethical cloud infrastructures**.  
Powered by **Mistral AI** (France) and deployable on **European providers such as OVHcloud, Infomaniak or Scaleway**, Kairn helps teams **understand, plan, and migrate** their workloads to **independent, privacy-focused, and open environments**.

Kairn promotes a vision of **transparent, self-hostable, and open technologies**â€”because sovereignty and innovation must go hand in hand.

## Why Kairn

Most AI and cloud tools today rely on U.S.-based infrastructures.  
**Kairn** proves that European technologies can deliver the same performance and reliabilityâ€”without sacrificing independence or openness.  
Itâ€™s built for **organizations seeking to regain control of their data and infrastructure**, while contributing to a **more open, sustainable, and sovereign digital ecosystem**.
